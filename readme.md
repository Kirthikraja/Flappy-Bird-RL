## Overview

This project extends the classic Flappy Bird into a flexible simulation environment, integrating:

- Procedural content generation (PCG) via predefined pipe patterns

- Dynamic theme transitions ("day", "night", "hell", "space")

- Multi-mode support: manual or RL agent-controlled gameplay

- Reinforcement learning agents including PPO and Double DQN

- Implemented in Python using the pygame library, this system is designed to evaluate gameplay adaptation across varying difficulty and visual themes.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- torch

You can install the required packages via pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Game Structure

### Manual Play
```bash
  python main.py
```

Controls:
- SPACE: Make the bird jump
- R: Restart the game after death

### Agent Play
```bash
  python agent_plays_game.py --model 1
```

Available Agents: (PPO, DDQN, DQN, SAC)

PPO
```bash
  --model 1 
```

DDQN
```bash
  --model 2 
```

DQN
```bash
  --model 3 
```

SAC
```bash
  --model 4 
```

## Themes and Procedural Content

The game dynamically switches between themes every few pipe intervals:

- Each theme changes background, ground, pipe style, and ambient sound.

- Procedural pipe patterns (zigzag, wave, etc.) are loaded with spacing and difficulty multipliers.

- Customizable via the PIPE_PATTERNS dictionary in settings.py

This PCG system allows testing agent generalization across aesthetic and gameplay variations.

## Notes

- RL agents are trained per theme for better generalization.
 
- The PPO agent uses Categorical policies and requires eval mode for inference.

- Manual and agent play use a shared World class for consistency.

- Agent step() and reset() methods follow RL API conventions.

- PCG and theme switching logic can be tuned in world.py

- Have fun experimenting with Flappy RL in space, hell, and beyond!
